# About IB Resources

IB Resources is a platform like no other, providing free resources to IB students to help them succeed. The interactive user interface of the website allows the user to easily navigate to the different pages in the website which have resources for different subjects.

# Check out the Website

The website is currently live at: https://ibresources.web.app

# Why Was It Developed

The idea behind IB Resources originated from the fact that I had recently graduated from the IB Diploma and had a lot of tips and resources that I thought that I could share with IB students currently struggling with the same things I went through in the 2 years of my IB Diploma, therefore I assorted all the resources I had and planned out a website to provide help to current IB Students.

# How Was It Developed

The project mainly uses HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript, although a little bit of React.js is utilized in some portions. Firebase was used for the backend although some other APIs were also used to enable the contact us and feedback forms. 

# Whats next for IB Resources

I plan to add a chat bot to the website that can answer the user's quiestions about the website and also about IB in general. Since it can be hard to manage incoming emails from the users, I decided I could transfer all my advice and guidance to a bot which can interact with the users to help them out. Apart from that, some advanced features are also planned for the website which involve heavy machine learning aspects. The biggest step forward is collecting enough data for student essays and designing an algorithm that can predict the grade that a user's essay can get. This is an ambitious step but I believe that its certainly doable with the current machine learning techniques.
